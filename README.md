About
-----

After using Telegram on iOS, I quickly realized how much I missed being able to watch [WebM](https://www.webmproject.org/) files on the go. Thanks to drama around [Google ditching Apple's WebKit](https://www.wired.com/2013/04/blink/), it's very likely that Apple devices will never support WebMs natively, so I built this bot.

Features
--------
- Converts WebMs to MP4
- Works in Group Chats

Installing
----------

Install nodejs, npm, and ffmpeg to your system.

Create a Telegram bot using their [official docs](https://core.telegram.org/bots/api).

Run `micro-bot -t ${BOT_TOKEN}`.

Usage
----------

Simply upload a WebM into any chat where the bot is a participant and it will reply with a fresh MP4.

Notes
----------

Converting videos is very CPU intensive. When using Heroku's free tier, it took 15 seconds to convert a small webm file. Your results will vary depending where you host this. I recommend hosting it locally.
